## Importing the Project
This project (and LibGDX) uses Gradle to install dependencies. Once you have cloned the project, follow [this link](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Setting-up-your-Development-Environment-%28Eclipse%2C-Intellij-IDEA%2C-NetBeans%29) to get your development environment ready. 

Once your development environment is ready, navigate to the root directory of the project, and run `./gradlew clean` (or `gradlew.bat` if you're on Windows) to download and install dependencies. This may take a couple of minutes.

Finally, import the project **as a Gradle Project** in your favorite IDE. [Follow LibGDX's import guide](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gradle-and-Eclipse) to import the project. That particular link is for Eclipse, but if you look on the table of contents, you will see setup guides for various other IDEs.

Lastly, please contact us on our [Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/EmergentOrganization/cell-rpg) if you're having any trouble, and we'd be more than happy to assist.
